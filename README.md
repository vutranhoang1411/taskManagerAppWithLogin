<h1> Task manager App With Login </h1>

<h2> A task manager app with log in, session-based authentication using EJS, Express and Mongoose </h2>
<p> A few thing about my app </p>
<ul>
  <li> For rendering, I use EJS and simple HTML,CSS,JS</li>
  <li> For the backend, I use Express with MongoDB to store user data (use Mongoose model) </li>
  <li> The code is written using MVC designd pattern </li>
  <li> Remember to set the MONGO_URI (the uri to connect to the server) and the sessionKey (for handle session) in the .env file</li>
</ul>
<p> One final notice: At the time I write this app, I'm still new to web dev so there might be some bug </p>
<p> Thank you for using my app &#128521 </p>
